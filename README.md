# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-5-DOF-Robotic-manipulator
This is a course project done for UMD course : ENPM 662 - Introdcution to Robot Modeling.

• Derived the forward and Inverse kinematics of the 5 DOF manipulator manually.
• Developed 3D Workspace visualization in MATLAB.
• Simulated the model using Simscape Multibody.
